    'content': '<p>A bit about me, I grew up in Cashmere WA, the youngest of 3 children. When I was a child my family moved over to Indonesia to work as teachers at an international school there. Living there for 3 years layed some fundamentals of who I am today. For instance, my willingness to travel and explore the world as well as my intercultural understanding. After the 3 years in Indonesia my family moved back to the US.</p><p>Following High School I joined the US Navy and served my country for 5 years as a Logistic specialist. Doing 3 deployments in the persian gulf from 2008 to 2013. During my time in the Navy I reconnected with a friend from my childhood in Indonesia and after my time in the service I persued her and moved over to Indonesia for a second time. We got married shortly after and now have two amazing boys.</p><p>While in Indonesia for the second time I went to UPH (Universitas Pelita Harapan) and earned my teaching degree. After my schooling was over I taught 4th grade at SPH (Sekolah Pelita Harapan) for 3 years. Interesting fact: this was the same internation school my parents taught at 17 years earlier. While teaching has its own benefits I found that I was always learning new code to try and create different applications to assist me in whatever I was doing, whether that be for my job or for recreational purposes.</p><p>I eventually came to the conclusion that I wanted to have a career change and pursue software development as a full time job. This lead me to the Coding Dojo bootcamp and then to another bootcamp at University of Washington.</p>'

        <h1>My Story</h1><p>I had a great time going to school at coding dojo. I started going to coding dojo after getting my degree as a teacher and working for a couple of years as a 4th grade teacher. While I was teaching I was writing my own small scripts and programs to help out in my teaching career. After a while I realized I enjoyed the coding that I was doing more than the teaching. Ergo my attendance at Coding Dojo. </p>
        <p>Even though I was going into Coding Dojo with some years of self taugh study behind me, Coding Dojo was tough. I was putting in about 65-70 hours a week and learning a lot. But because of the hard work I "black" belted in all three stacks that the program offered (python, MERN, C#). It was three months of intense work that was most enjoyable.</p>
        <p>I would recomend Coding Dojo to anybody who is serious about learning to code in a short amount of time. It really shows you an overview of the different types of technologies that are out there. And is a great way to jump start your way into a new career!</p>
